        Server actually replying automatically generated message id. This message id contain 2 parts separated by "-"
            1615343888653-0
        The first part is actually a millisecond resolution timestamp which is an unsigned 64 bit integer
        The second part of the message. it is an internal sequence that provides some millisecond resolution because it is 
            possible for multiple messages to be added inside the span of single message. So let's say if we added 100 messages
            in one millisecond, then it will increase

10 xadd temprature * temp_f 50.7 location_id 1020 temp_f 29.6 location_id 4050
        This command will be executed ten times, it is possible that when we are going to execute this command 10 times, some of
            data is actually added at a particular millisecond as well

xadd manual 101-1 foo bar
        generate message IDs on our own 
xrange manual - +
xadd manual 100-1 foo bar
        If we try to add data at a lower message ID(100 is lower 101), that is not possible. We have to generate message ID greater 
            than previousone
xadd manual 102-1 foo bar
xadd manual 102-2 foo bar


del manual


xadd manual 101 foo bar
        When we just do not provide the second part of the message, it is automatically assign the internal sequence as zero
xadd manual 101 foo bar
        If we want to try again, it is can not because 101 already have 101
xadd manual 102 foo bar
xadd manual 102-1 foo bar
